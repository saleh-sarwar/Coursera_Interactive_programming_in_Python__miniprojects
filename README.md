Contains different games given as project in the course to practice and use the different concepts of python language. Since it was an introductory course, at the begining, global variables were used in different projects. Later with uses of classes, the use of global variables were limited to just a few.

Below each projects are briefly described.

## 1) Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock:
Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock (RPSLS) is a variant of Rock-paper-scissors that allows five choices.
